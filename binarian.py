"""
A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N non-negative integers is given
Its binarian is defined as:
binarian(A) =   pow2(A[0]) + pow2(A[1]) + ... + pow2(A[Nâˆ’1])
pow2(K) =   2K
For example, the binarian of array A such that:
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 5
  A[2] = 4
equals 50:
binarian(A) =   pow2(A[0]) + pow2(A[1]) + pow2(A[2])
    =   pow2(1) + pow2(5) + pow2(4)
    =   2 + 32 + 16
    =   50
Write a function:
def solution(A)
that, given an array A consisting of N non-negative integers, returns the
length of the shortest array that has the same binarian as array A.
For example, given array A such that:
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  A[2] = 2
  A[3] = 0
  A[4] = 0
  A[5] = 2
the function should return 3 because:
the binarian of A is 13,
array B such that B[0] = 3, B[1] = 2 and B[2] = 0 also has a binarian of 13,
there is no shorter array with a binarian of 13.
Assume that:
N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..10,000].
Complexity:
expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input
storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
Elements of input arrays can be modified.
