"""
Given a sorted array of integers, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithmâ€™s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

Example:

Given [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]

and target value 8,

return [3, 4].

        Here, my helper function is a simple binary search, telling me the first
        index where I could insert a number n into nums to keep it sorted. Thus,
        if nums contains target, I can find the first occurrence with search(target).
        I do that, and if target isn't actually there, then I return [-1, -1].
        Otherwise, I ask search(target+1), which tells me the first index where I
        could insert target+1, which of course is one index behind the last index containing
        target, so all I have left to do is subtract 1.
