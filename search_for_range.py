"""
Given a sorted array of integers, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithmâ€™s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

Example:

Given [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]

and target value 8,

return [3, 4].

        Article explanation: https://leetcode.com/articles/search-for-a-range/
        
        Here, search method is a simple binary search, telling us the first
        index where we could insert 'n' into nums to keep it sorted. Thus,
        if nums contains target, we'll return the first occurrence with search(target).
        we do that, and if target isn't actually there, then I return [-1, -1].
        Otherwise, I ask search(target+1), which tells me the first index where I
        could insert target+1, which of course is one index behind the last index containing
        target, so all I have left to do is subtract 1.
