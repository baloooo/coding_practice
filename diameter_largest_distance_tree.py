Find largest distance
Given an arbitrary unweighted rooted tree which consists of N (2 <= N <= 40000)
nodes. The goal of the problem is to find largest distance between two nodes in
a tree. Distance between two nodes is a number of edges on a path between the
nodes (there will be a unique path between any pair of nodes since it is a tree
). The nodes will be numbered 0 through N - 1.

The tree is given as an array P, there is an edge between nodes P[i] and
i (0 <= i < N). Exactly one of the iâ€™s will have P[i] equal to -1, it will be
root node.

    Example:
    If given P is [-1, 0, 0, 0, 3], then node 0 is the root and the whole tree
    looks like this:

          0
       /  |  \
      1   2   3
               \
                4

    One of the longest path is 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 4 and its length is 3, thus the
    answer is 3. Note that there are other paths with maximal distance.

        Basically this exercise boils down to finding height of the tree
        at every node. Max diameter or max length of path would be just
        sum of left subtree and right subtree which can be checked at every
        node and kept track of. Notice we would progress the recursion
        exactly like we would for finding height of the tree since for
        each subtree we want to find the max height.
