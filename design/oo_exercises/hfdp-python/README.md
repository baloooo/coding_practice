Head First Design Patterns Python

Trying to port the cool patterns showcased at the awesome book 'Head First Design Patterns' to Python.

So far, I've got covered the following patterns:
* Strategy
* Observer
* Decorator
* Factory
* Singleton
* Command
* Adapter
Okay, you don’t want to solve the problem by changing your existing code (and you can’t change the vendor’s code). So what do you do? Well, you can write a class that adapts the new vendor interface into the one you’re expecting.
The adapter acts as the middleman by receiving requests from the client and converting them into requests that make sense on the vendor classes.
* Facade
* Template method
* Composite
* Status pattern
* Combining patterns
